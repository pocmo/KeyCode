An Android application for displaying the KeyCodes of pressed keys.

This application is mostly for debugging purposes.

Non default behavior found up to now:
 - The Enter key on the Motorola Milestone does only send a key down event (KeyEvent.ACTION_DOWN) and
   no key up event (KeyEvent.ACTION_UP).
